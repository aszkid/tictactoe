# tictactoe
AI experiment -- knowledge extrapolation to higher dimensionality situations

This is the code for our Research Project, a year-long school project on artificial intelligence. This is a quick and dirty Javascript implementation of our idea; by training a a neural network to play the traditional TicTacToe game, we try to extrapolate the "knowledge" obtained and achieve considerably better results for a 4x4 situation compared with a random player.
